# scoreboard
The scoreboard application I have included here is the one I submitted for the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Program.
This project actually made me feel like I was coding something that actually worked.
I thoroughly enjoyed bringing this project to completion and having it load and run correctly on my phone for the first time.
